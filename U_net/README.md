## About this fork

This project is a fork of [theMenonlab/CCM_Project](https://github.com/University-of-Utah-Rich/CCM_project). This fork modifies only the U_net files to automate the download and installation of necessary python modules and training data.
 The training data is already in a form consumable by tensorflow, thus all one needs to do is run the train_network notebook.
